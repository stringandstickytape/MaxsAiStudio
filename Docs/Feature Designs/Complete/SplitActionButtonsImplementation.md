# Feature Implementation: Split Action Buttons

## Overview

This implementation splits the previously combined send/cancel/interject button in the input bar into three separate buttons, each with a dedicated function. This improves usability by making each action more explicit and discoverable.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ActionButtons Component Modifications

The `ActionButtons` component was modified to:

- Replace the single multi-purpose button with three separate buttons
- Add conditional rendering for each button based on the current state:
  - **Send button**: Visible when not loading
  - **Cancel button**: Visible when loading and not cancelling
  - **Interject button**: Visible when loading, not cancelling, and a message has been sent
- Add the `MessageSquarePlus` icon from Lucide React for the interjection button
- Implement a dedicated `handleInterjection` function within the component
- Accept additional props: `onCancel`, `inputText`, `setInputText`, and `messageSent`

### 2. InputBar Component Modifications

The `InputBar` component was updated to:

- Pass the necessary props to the `ActionButtons` component
- Implement a dedicated cancel handler function
- Simplify the `handleSend` function to only handle sending messages
- Pass the input text state and setter to the `ActionButtons` component
- Pass a `messageSent` flag to indicate when a message has been sent and is being processed

## User Experience

1. **When composing a message**:
   - Only the Send button is visible
   - Clicking Send sends the message

2. **During AI processing**:
   - The Send button is replaced with Cancel and Interject buttons
   - Cancel button (red with X icon) stops the current processing
   - Interject button (with MessageSquarePlus icon) sends additional information during processing

3. **When cancelling**:
   - Both Cancel and Interject buttons are disabled during cancellation

## Benefits

- **Improved clarity**: Each button has a single, clear purpose
- **Better discoverability**: The interjection feature is now more visible
- **Enhanced usability**: Users can more easily understand the available actions
- **Reduced errors**: Less chance of accidentally cancelling when trying to send an interjection

## Technical Implementation

- The implementation follows React best practices with conditional rendering
- Each button maintains consistent styling with the rest of the application
- The buttons are properly disabled when their actions are not available
- The implementation builds on the existing interjection functionality
