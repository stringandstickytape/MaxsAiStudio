TODO:
DONE: Token counting
DONE: Support bitmaps (OpenAI and Claude)
DONE: Support system prompts
DONE: Support categories
DONE: Amend ButtonedRichTextBox with a param, if true, flash when content updated
DONE: Make passwords configurable
DONE: pass thru stringselected insatead of using event per layer
DONE: Streaming
DONE: Add dummy root message to conversations, to join root user messages together
DONE: add clear-search button
DONE: add multiple files attach button
DONE: add "continue..." funcitionality that concats messages, prob don't need to keep sensible history of this
DONE: JSON array viewer might be nice

Critical (could make software unusable):
Handle if there's no local AI
It probably sucks when the AI is running and the user changes conversations
Do more to not mess up the conversation if user changes nodes while the AI is running

Useful next:
Ongoing token counting
Streaming token counting
add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
fix images aren't included in history
add delete-template and save-as-new-template
add delete-node-chain with are-you-sure? (is it chain, or just node?)


Less important:
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
inline js dependencies and add open-source licenses
enable/disable cs/html highlighting





source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?

launch sql? browse xml? launch svg? launch powershell?  azure az command?! 

json mode

**** pick specific summarisation model
 => is the AI model dropdown moving to the web ui, or not?!

Local web front-end - genericise existing html somehow?

*** llava support

highlight the currently-selected template in the templates menu

Add template category

Delete template


Allow choice of embedding engines (?)




Necessary for release:

Make default engine sticky
allow setting of proper URLs for local AI
Github version update code
better error-trapping


example templates set

add template category
delete template
Handle if there's no local AI
It probably sucks when the AI is running and the user changes conversations
Do more to not mess up the conversation if user changes nodes while the AI is running

	- this could all be fixed if the AI response was joined back to its original conversation sensibly... :/

fix summaries are being generated using embeddings (!)
Cublas and non-Cublas builds
Instructions for external apps: whisper, ...
Check whisper works
Make demo videos or screenshots
2/5: fix images aren't included in history
DONE: Licenses 
DONE: Inline JS for appropriate packages : D3 v7, cytoscape, jsoneditor
DONE: discard edit-highlighting-colours functionality
Embeddings - make sure they're not being used for summaries
Embeddings - provide drop-down to choose embedding from a specific directory
