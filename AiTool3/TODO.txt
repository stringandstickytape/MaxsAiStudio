DONE: Support system prompts
DONE: Support categories
DONE: Amend ButtonedRichTextBox with a param, if true, flash when content updated
DONE: Make passwords configurable
DONE: pass thru stringselected insatead of using event per layer
DONE: Streaming
DONE: Add dummy root message to conversations, to join root user messages together
DONE: add clear-search button
DONE: add multiple files attach button
DONE: add "continue..." funcitionality that concats messages, prob don't need to keep sensible history of this

Critical (could make software unusable):
Handle if there's no local AI
It probably sucks when the AI is running and the user changes conversations
Do more to not mess up the conversation if user changes nodes while the AI is running

Useful next:
Add labels to UI
Ongoing token counting
add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
fix images aren't included in history
add delete-template and save-as-new-template
add delete-node-chain with are-you-sure? (is it chain, or just node?)
enable/disable cs/html highlighting

Less important:
JSON array viewer might be nice?
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
inline js dependencies and add open-source licenses
complete edit-highlighting-colours functionality




source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?
