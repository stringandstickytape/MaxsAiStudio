DONE: llava support
DONE: Add template category
DONE: send embeddings wrong colour after clicking node in ndc
DONE: File drag-and-drop

DONE: drag and drop urls to main part of window
DONE: highlight the currently-selected template in the templates menu
DONE: Delete template
DONE: "NONE" option at the top of the templates menu
DONE: add big yellow use-embeddings button? Add text "WITH EMBEDDINGS" to send button and make it yellow?
DONE: delete template
DONE: if there's no local AI at all, deal with it

DONE: Make use of token counting
DONE: fix scroll to bottom when adding streaming fragment
DONE: Hide project browser behind experimental setting? At least needs tidying up
DONE: Image from clipboard
DONE: cr's in template names cause menu nastiness
DONE: On first run, create subdirs: Conversations, Settings, Templates, Embeddings





Known Limitations:
No Base64 image support for Groq
No streaming token counting for OpenAI (implemented for Claude, LocalAI, Gemini)
No token counting for Groq

Useful next:

add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
add delete-template and save-as-new-template/copy template
alter to proper attachments model w multiple images, files saved in original form, etc?
move conversations to subdirectory, templates to another, settings to a third?

are there any prompt libraries we can pull from?

Create embeddings from previous messages/conversations?

popup that lets you pick embedding results to submit?

Expand and clarify the embeddings workflow


Necessary for release:

First-run "wizard"
 - ask for API/local AI details?
 - default the engine dropdowns as such



Make Regen All Summaries more friendly
Add "working" to:
* create embeddings
* regen all summaries
* transcribe

Remove unnecessary experiments

Templates:
example templates set

Build:
Cublas and non-Cublas builds for whisperx - need dlls from another source - whisperX?

UI:
allow setting of proper URLs for local AI
Allow choice of embedding engine

Core:
better error-trapping - where are the crashes tho? . what happens if there's no network? 400 bad request is caught tho.

Github version check
inline https://unpkg.com/viz.js@2.1.2/viz.js

Embeddings:
Include embedding model name in default filename ext
Add spinner while embeddings are generated

Docs:
Instructions for external apps: whisper, ...
Instructions for usage
Make demo videos or screenshots

Testing:

Check whisper still works through microphone

Thid-party utils:

* Ollama: install, ollama pull <model>.  Need to pull mxbai-embed-large for embeddings.

fix // bit thin, this...


Possibly post-release:

js => jsx
project helper: # to include files?
project helper: fox fixed or new files, write to project structure? (!) - could use tool for this?
popup that lets you interfere with the embeddings selected...!
source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?
launch sql? browse xml? launch svg? azure az command?! 
json mode / tools ?
Local web front-end - genericise existing html somehow?
tools support? pull from api? what public apis could we test with?
launch JS directly would be nice

Copy response as raw text (no backtick issues!)

enable/disable cs/html highlighting
Pick-a-frame-from-a-video

*  syntax highlighting in messages

support markdown? :/
regex viewer? :/
GraphViz ??
SVG? we already have svg-pan-zoom
css viewer?

It'd be nice if you could outright edit responses in the conversation - should really be able to do this
Concatenate messages :(
Tip of the day
add tokens-per-second to the status bar?
Different Whisper models w/ UI

templates edit window is pretty crappy





pie-in-the-sky:
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
AI ideas:
• Ability to export conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Ability to import conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Collaborative real-time editing for shared conversations lol
• Sentiment analysis for conversation messages lol
