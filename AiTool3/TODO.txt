DONE(ish): Embeddings - provide drop-down to choose embedding from a specific directory
DONE: llava support
DONE: Add template category
DONE: send embeddings wrong colour after clicking node in ndc
DONE: File drag-and-drop
DONE: Handle if there's no local AI (is this an issue at all? if port is closed, it just doesn't work)
DONE: drag and drop urls to main part of window
DONE: highlight the currently-selected template in the templates menu
DONE: Delete template
DONE: "NONE" option at the top of the templates menu
DONE: add big yellow use-embeddings button? Add text "WITH EMBEDDINGS" to send button and make it yellow?
DONE: delete template
DONE: if there's no local AI at all, deal with it
DONE: It'd be lovely if you could highlight a conversation with one of four nice pastel colours, to mark one for later reference
DONE: Rename to MaxsAiStudio
DONE: tiny bug: fullscreen user prompt button is a Bit Crap


tiny bug: chat window types urls and other text content dropped directly :/
bug: new-with-context doesn't work properly



Critical (could make software unusable):


Useful next:
Ongoing, resettable token counting
Streaming token counting
add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
add delete-template and save-as-new-template/copy template
add delete-node-chain with are-you-sure? (is it chain, or just node?)
alter to proper attachments model w multiple images, files saved in original form, etc?

Less important:
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
inline js dependencies and add open-source licenses
enable/disable cs/html highlighting






source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?
launch sql? browse xml? launch svg? azure az command?! 
json mode / tools ?
Local web front-end - genericise existing html somehow?
tools support? pull from api? what public apis could we test with?
launch JS directly would be nice


Necessary for release:



Templates:
example templates set

Build:
Cublas and non-Cublas builds - need dlls from another source - whisperX?

UI:
allow setting of proper URLs for local AI
Allow choice of embedding engine

Core:
better error-trapping - where are the crashes tho? . what happens if there's no network? 400 bad request is caught tho.
add date/time of conversdation start to DGV
Make convo browser visible sticky

Github version update code
4/5: fix images aren't included in Groq history
add mermaid to licenses and remove CDNs, possiby also other pkg references

Embeddings:
Include embedding model name in default filename ext
Add spinner while embeddings are generated

Docs:
Instructions for external apps: whisper, ...
Make demo videos or screenshots

Testing:
Check whisper works through microphone


It'd be nice if you could outright edit responses in the conversation

AI ideas:
• Ability to export conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Ability to import conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Collaborative real-time editing for shared conversations lol
• Sentiment analysis for conversation messages lol
*  syntax highlighting in messages

Concatenate messages :(

Tip of the day





add tokens-per-second to the status bar?
