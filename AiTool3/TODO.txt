DONE: add clear-search button
DONE: add multiple files attach button
DONE: add "continue..." funcitionality that concats messages, prob don't need to keep sensible history of this
DONE: JSON array viewer might be nice
DONE: It probably sucks when the AI is running and the user changes conversations
DONE: Do more to not mess up the conversation if user changes nodes while the AI is running
DONE: Licenses 
DONE: Inline JS for appropriate packages : D3 v7, cytoscape, jsoneditor
DONE: discard edit-highlighting-colours functionality
DONE: Make default engine sticky
DONE: add template category



Critical (could make software unusable):
Handle if there's no local AI

Useful next:
Ongoing token counting
Streaming token counting
add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
add delete-template and save-as-new-template
add delete-node-chain with are-you-sure? (is it chain, or just node?)
alter to proper attachments model w multiple images, files saved in original form, etc?

Less important:
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
inline js dependencies and add open-source licenses
enable/disable cs/html highlighting

source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?

launch sql? browse xml? launch svg? launch powershell?  azure az command?! 

json mode

**** pick specific summarisation model
 => is the AI model dropdown moving to the web ui, or not?!

Local web front-end - genericise existing html somehow?

*** llava support

highlight the currently-selected template in the templates menu

Add template category

Delete template




tools



Necessary for release:

Bugs - fix the horrific double-press-of-Send bug

Templates:
"NONE" option at the top of the templates menu
example templates set
delete template

Build:
Cublas and non-Cublas builds - need dlls from another source - whisperX?

UI:
add big yellow use-embeddings button? Add text "WITH EMBEDDINGS" to send button and make it yellow?
allow setting of proper URLs for local AI
Allow choice of summary engine and embedding engine

Core:
better error-trapping - where are the crashes tho? . what happens if there's no network? 400 bad request is caught tho.
Handle if there's no local AI at all
Github version update code
2/5: fix images aren't included in history (not implemented at all for groq)

Embeddings:
Embeddings - make sure they're not being used for summaries
Embeddings - provide drop-down to choose embedding from a specific directory
Include embedding model name in filename

Docs:
Instructions for external apps: whisper, ...
Make demo videos or screenshots

Testing:
Check whisper works

It'd be lovely if you could highlight a conversation with one of four nice pastel colours, to mark one for later reference
It'd be nice if you could outright edit responses in the conversation

AI ideas:
• Ability to export conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Ability to import conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Collaborative real-time editing for shared conversations lol
• Sentiment analysis for conversation messages lol
*  syntax highlighting in messages

Concatenate messages :(

Tip of the day

add mermaid to licenses and remove CDNs, possiby also other pkg references
