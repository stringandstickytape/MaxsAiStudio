Critical (could make software unusable):
Handle if there's no local AI

Useful next:
Ongoing token counting
Streaming token counting
add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
add delete-template and save-as-new-template
add delete-node-chain with are-you-sure? (is it chain, or just node?)
alter to proper attachments model w multiple images, files saved in original form, etc?

Less important:
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
inline js dependencies and add open-source licenses
enable/disable cs/html highlighting

source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?

launch sql? browse xml? launch svg? launch powershell?  azure az command?! 

json mode

**** pick specific summarisation model
 => is the AI model dropdown moving to the web ui, or not?!

Local web front-end - genericise existing html somehow?

*** llava support

highlight the currently-selected template in the templates menu

Add template category

Delete template




tools



Necessary for release:

allow setting of proper URLs for local AI
Github version update code
better error-trapping - where are the crashes tho?
add big yellow use-embeddings button?
example templates set
add template category
delete template
Handle if there's no local AI
fix summaries are being generated using embeddings (!)
Cublas and non-Cublas builds - need dlls from another source - whisperX?
Instructions for external apps: whisper, ...
Check whisper works
Make demo videos or screenshots
2/5: fix images aren't included in history (not implemented at all for groq)
Embeddings - make sure they're not being used for summaries
Embeddings - provide drop-down to choose embedding from a specific directory
Allow choice of summary engine and embedding engine
Refresh templates menu after add/edit/delete/...
