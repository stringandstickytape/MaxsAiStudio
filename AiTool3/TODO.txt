Known Limitations:
No Base64 image support for Groq
No streaming token counting for OpenAI (implemented for Claude, LocalAI, Gemini)
No token counting for Groq

Give me the full file button?
- button is a combination of prompt and engine

Add "go to top" button at bottom of message

Necessary for release:

Expand and clarify the embeddings workflow esp the checkboxes
 - Include embedding model name in default filename ext
Parameterise conda loading
Add "working" to transcribe
Remove unnecessary experiments
example templates set
Allow choice of embedding engine?
better error-trapping - where are the crashes tho? . what happens if there's no network? 400 bad request is caught tho.
Github version check

Docs:
Instructions for external apps: whisper, ...
Instructions for usage
Make demo videos or screenshots

Thid-party utils:

* Ollama: install, ollama pull <model>.  Need to pull mxbai-embed-large for embeddings.

project helper: # to include files?




add a few gradients?
project helper: for fixed or new files, write to project structure? (!) - could use tool for this?
popup that lets you interfere with the embeddings selected...!
source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?
launch sql? browse xml? launch svg? azure az command?! 
launch JS directly would be nice
Choose-microphone

enable/disable cs/html highlighting
Pick-a-frame-from-a-video

*  syntax highlighting in messages

support markdown? :/
regex viewer? :/
GraphViz ??
css viewer?

Fade out and back in instead of smooth scrolling?
Templaets should be able to specify tools they're used wsith => colour scheme tool!
add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
alter to proper attachments model w multiple images, files saved in original form, etc?

Tip of the day
add tokens-per-second to the status bar?
Different Whisper models w/ UI
templates edit window is pretty crappy

Create embeddings from previous messages/conversations?
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
AI ideas:
• Ability to export conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Ability to import conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Collaborative real-time editing for shared conversations lol
• Sentiment analysis for conversation messages lol




~~~ Tools

an ai tool, in this context, is one an AI can use to request that an action be carried out, outside its domain, to help complete its assigned task. Completely rewrite your list
