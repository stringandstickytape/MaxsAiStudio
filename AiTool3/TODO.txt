DONE: add a "continue" button at the end of an unterminated code block.  When clicked, fetch the next response and auto-concat.





Known Limitations:
No Base64 image support for Groq
No streaming token counting for OpenAI (implemented for Claude, LocalAI, Gemini)
No token counting for Groq

Useful next:

Persistent themes
Templaets should be able to specify tools they're used wsith => colour scheme tool!
add time-taken to search results and timestamp to all convo messages
add delete-template and save-as-new-template/copy template
alter to proper attachments model w multiple images, files saved in original form, etc?
move conversations to subdirectory, templates to another, settings to a third?

Create embeddings from previous messages/conversations?

popup that lets you pick embedding results to submit?

Expand and clarify the embeddings workflow


Necessary for release:

First-run "wizard"
 - ask for API/local AI details?
 - default the engine dropdowns as such



Add "working" to:
* regen all summaries
* transcribe

Remove unnecessary experiments

Templates:
example templates set

Build:
Cublas and non-Cublas builds for whisperx (file transcription) - need dlls from another source - whisperX?

UI:
allow setting of proper URLs for local AI
Allow choice of embedding engine

Core:
better error-trapping - where are the crashes tho? . what happens if there's no network? 400 bad request is caught tho.
That weird one where you've picked a conersation but not a mesasge, and try to send a new message.  I suppose when you click a conversation, it could jump to the most recent message.

Github version check
inline https://unpkg.com/viz.js@2.1.2/viz.js

Embeddings:
Include embedding model name in default filename ext

Docs:
Instructions for external apps: whisper, ...
Instructions for usage
Make demo videos or screenshots

Testing:

Check whisper still works through microphone

Thid-party utils:

* Ollama: install, ollama pull <model>.  Need to pull mxbai-embed-large for embeddings.

fix // bit thin, this...


js => jsx

project helper: # to include files?

project helper: fox fixed or new files, write to project structure? (!) - could use tool for this?
popup that lets you interfere with the embeddings selected...!
source code browser thing, to let you choose which files to upload from your project?
launch sql? browse xml? launch svg? azure az command?! 
launch JS directly would be nice

Copy response as raw text (no backtick issues!)

enable/disable cs/html highlighting
Pick-a-frame-from-a-video

*  syntax highlighting in messages

support markdown? :/
regex viewer? :/
GraphViz ??
SVG? we already have svg-pan-zoom
css viewer?

It'd be nice if you could outright edit responses in the conversation - should really be able to do this
Concatenate messages :(
Tip of the day
add tokens-per-second to the status bar?
Different Whisper models w/ UI

templates edit window is pretty crappy





pie-in-the-sky:
Custom handlers? External links to other apps or handlers?
AI ideas:
• Ability to export conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Ability to import conversations in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
• Collaborative real-time editing for shared conversations lol
• Sentiment analysis for conversation messages lol




~~~ Tools

an ai tool, in this context, is one an AI can use to request that an action be carried out, outside its domain, to help complete its assigned task. Completely rewrite your list
AI
I apologize for the misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying. Here's a revised list of 20 AI tools that an AI could request to use for completing tasks outside its domain:

1. Web scraper: to gather information from websites
2. Database query executor: to retrieve specific data from databases
3. File system navigator: to search and access files on a system
4. API caller: to interact with external services and fetch data
5. Email sender: to compose and send emails
6. Calendar scheduler: to create, modify, or delete calendar events
7. Document converter: to change file formats (e.g., PDF to Word)
8. Image editor: to manipulate images (resize, crop, filter)
9. Video processor: to edit or analyze video content
10. Audio manipulator: to edit or analyze audio files
11. Geolocation service: to get or interpret geographic data
12. Weather data fetcher: to retrieve current or forecasted weather information
13. Currency converter: to perform real-time currency conversions
14. Social media poster: to publish content on various social platforms
15. SMS sender: to send text messages to phone numbers
16. Data visualizer: to create charts or graphs from datasets
17. QR code generator: to create QR codes from given information
18. URL shortener: to create shortened versions of long URLs
19. Encryption/decryption tool: to secure or access protected information
20. System resource monitor: to check CPU, memory, or disk usage
