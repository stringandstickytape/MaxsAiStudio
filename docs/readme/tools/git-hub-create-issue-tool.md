# GitHubCreateIssueTool
*Creates a new issue in the specified repository.*

## Purpose

This tool allows the AI to create new GitHub issues programmatically. It's useful for bug reporting, feature requests, task creation, and project management workflows. All content created by this tool includes an attribution line indicating it was generated by Max's AI Studio.

## Parameters

- `owner` (string, required): Repository owner.
- `repo` (string, required): Repository name.
- `title` (string, required): The title of the issue.
- `body` (string, optional): The contents of the issue (Markdown).
- `labels` (array, optional): Array of label names to apply.
- `assignees` (array, optional): Array of login names to assign.
- `milestone` (integer, optional): The number of the milestone to associate this issue with.

## Example Usage

To create a simple bug report:
```json
{
  "owner": "microsoft",
  "repo": "vscode",
  "title": "Button not responding in settings panel",
  "body": "## Description\nThe save button in the settings panel doesn't respond to clicks.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open settings\n2. Make a change\n3. Click save button\n4. Nothing happens\n\n## Expected Behavior\nSettings should be saved.",
  "labels": ["bug", "ui"]
}
```

To create a feature request with assignees:
```json
{
  "owner": "myorg",
  "repo": "myproject",
  "title": "Add dark mode support",
  "body": "Users have requested a dark mode option for better usability in low-light environments.",
  "labels": ["enhancement", "ui"],
  "assignees": ["developer1", "designer2"],
  "milestone": 5
}
```

## Output Format

Returns confirmation of successful issue creation including:
- New issue number
- Issue title
- Direct URL to the created issue on GitHub

## Requirements

- A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) must be configured in AiStudio4 (`File > Settings > Set GitHub API Key...`).
- The PAT must have `repo` scope (or `public_repo` for public repositories only).
- Write access to the target repository is required.

## Notes

- All issue bodies created by this tool will include an attribution line: "*Content created by GitHubCreateIssue via Max's AI Studio*"
- Labels and assignees must already exist in the repository.
- Milestone numbers can be found in the repository's milestone list.
- If any optional arrays (labels, assignees) are provided but empty, they will be ignored.
