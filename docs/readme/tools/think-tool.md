# ThinkTool

*Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.*

## Usage

This tool allows the AI to articulate its thought process, make plans, or explain its reasoning without taking any external action (like modifying files or calling other APIs). The content of the `thought` parameter is typically logged and returned to the user as part of the AI's response, often before or after other tool calls.

**Parameters:**
-   `thought` (string, required): The thought, plan, or reasoning the AI wants to express.

## Examples

Before attempting to modify a complex piece of code, the AI might use `ThinkTool`:

```json
{
  "thought": "The user wants to add error handling to the `process_data` function. I need to identify the main try-catch block or add one if it doesn't exist. I will first read the file to understand its current structure, then plan the specific code modifications. I should be careful not to alter existing logic unintentionally."
}
```

After analyzing search results, the AI might use it to summarize findings:

```json
{
  "thought": "The search results indicate three potential libraries for this task: LibA, LibB, and LibC. LibA seems most popular but LibC has better documentation for our specific use case. I will proceed by recommending LibC."
}
```

## Notes

-   The `ThinkTool` itself does **not** pause the tool loop or wait for user input (unlike `InfoRequestTool`). It's a way for the AI to "talk to itself" or "show its work" transparently.
-   The output of `ThinkTool` (the `thought` content) is usually aggregated with other tool outputs and presented to you when the AI either calls `StopTool` or `InfoRequestTool`.
-   This is very useful for debugging the AI's decision-making process and understanding why it chooses certain actions or tools.
