# CreateNewFileTool

*Creates a new file with the specified content.*

## Usage

This tool allows the AI to create a new file at a specified path within your project. You must provide the full path (relative to your project root if the AI uses relative paths, or absolute if the AI is configured that way) and the content for the new file.

**Parameters:**
-   `path` (string, required): The absolute path where the new file should be created. This path must be within the currently set Project Path in AiStudio4.
-   `content` (string, required): The text content for the new file. Can be an empty string if an empty file is desired.
-   `description` (string, required): A brief explanation of why this file is being created.

## Examples

To create a new file named `config.json` in a `settings` subfolder of your project with some JSON content:

```json
{
  "path": "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Projects\\MyWebApp\\settings\\config.json",
  "content": "{\n  \"theme\": \"dark\",\n  \"notifications\": true\n}",
  "description": "Create a default configuration file for the application."
}
```

Or, if the AI is providing a path relative to the project root:

```json
{
  "path": "settings/config.json", 
  "content": "{\n  \"theme\": \"dark\",\n  \"notifications\": true\n}",
  "description": "Create a default configuration file for the application."
}
```

## Notes

-   The tool will create any necessary parent directories if they don't exist, as long as the path is within the project root.
-   If a file already exists at the specified `path`, this tool will **fail**. Use `ReplaceFileTool` or `ModifyFilesTool` if you intend to overwrite or change an existing file.
-   The `description` parameter is for logging and auditing purposes and helps understand the AI's intent.
