}
```

To ask for more information:
```json

  "repo": "myproject",
  "issue_number": 890,
  "body": "## Workaround Available\n\nWhile we work on a permanent fix, you can use this workaround:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build --legacy-peer-deps\n```\n\nThis should resolve the immediate issue until we release the proper fix in v2.1.0."
