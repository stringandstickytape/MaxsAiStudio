# ThinkAndAwaitUserInputTool

*Use the tool to think about something and then explicitly await user input. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed, and you require user feedback or confirmation before proceeding. This tool's operation will stop AI processing to wait for the user.*

## Usage

This tool allows the AI to articulate its thought process, make plans, or explain its reasoning, and then pause its operation to wait for explicit input or confirmation from the user. The content of the `thought` parameter is typically logged and returned to the user as part of the AI's response. The AI will not proceed with further actions until the user provides a response.

**Parameters:**
-   `thought` (string, required): The thought, plan, or reasoning the AI wants to express before pausing.

## Examples

Before making a critical decision with multiple options, the AI might use `ThinkAndAwaitUserInputTool`:

```json
{
  "thought": "I have identified two potential approaches to refactor the authentication module. Approach A involves using a new library X, which is more modern but might require significant changes. Approach B is to incrementally improve the existing code, which is lower risk but might not address all underlying issues. Which approach do you prefer?"
}
```

After proposing a file deletion, the AI might use it to ask for confirmation:

```json
{
  "thought": "I am about to delete the file 'C:\Users\maxhe\source\repos\MaxsAiStudio\old_config.json' as it appears to be obsolete. Please confirm if I should proceed."
}
```

## Notes

-   The `ThinkAndAwaitUserInputTool` **always** pauses the AI's execution and waits for the user to respond. This is its primary difference from the `ThinkAndContinueTool`.
-   This tool is useful when the AI needs to ensure the user agrees with a proposed plan, wants to offer choices, or requires clarification before taking potentially irreversible actions.
-   The user's subsequent input will then guide the AI's next steps.
