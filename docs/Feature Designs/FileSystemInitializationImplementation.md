# File System Initialization Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the file system initialization feature, which ensures that the client application has access to the file system structure immediately after startup.

## Problem Statement
Previously, the client application only received file system updates via WebSocket notifications when changes occurred. There was no mechanism to fetch the initial file system state when the application started, which could lead to an incomplete view of the file system until changes were made.

## Solution
Implement a complete solution to fetch the file system data (directories and files) from the server during application startup.

## Implementation Details

### Server-side Changes
1. Created a new `FileSystemRequestHandler` class that implements the `IRequestHandler` interface
2. Implemented the `HandleAsync` method to return the current directories and files from the `IProjectFileWatcherService`
3. The handler responds to the `getFileSystem` request type

### Client-side Changes
1. Created a new `useFileSystemManagement` hook using the `createResourceHook` pattern
2. The hook fetches data from the `/api/getFileSystem` endpoint
3. Added the hook to the `CommandInitializer` component
4. Included the file system data fetch in the initial data loading process

## Benefits
- The client application now has a complete view of the file system immediately after startup
- Consistent with the existing patterns for resource management in the application
- Leverages the existing infrastructure for API requests and WebSocket notifications

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding pagination or filtering options if the file system becomes very large
- Add caching mechanisms to reduce server load
- Implement more granular file system operations (e.g., fetch only a specific directory)
