This application is a full‐featured, React/TypeScript–based chat and AI tool management system built using modern libraries such as Zustand (for state management), Axios (for API calls), and WebSockets (for real-time communications). 
It is architected in a modular way using a “feature–driven” file structure with clearly separated concerns.

The backend is written in C#.
