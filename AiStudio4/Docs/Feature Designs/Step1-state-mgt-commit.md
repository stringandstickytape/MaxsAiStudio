# State Management Improvements Commit

Implemented comprehensive state management improvements as outlined in Step1-state-mgt.md:

1. Created a Command Registry Service (`commandRegistry.ts`) that provides a centralized interface for command management, replacing direct store access.

2. Created a Window Events Service (`windowEvents.ts`) that provides a centralized registry of window events with helper functions, improving maintainability.

3. Refactored all command files to use these new services:
   - coreCommands.ts
   - settingsCommands.ts
   - systemPromptCommands.ts
   - themeCommands.ts
   - toolCommands.ts
   - userPromptCommands.ts

4. Refactored components to use the new services:
   - CommandInitializationPlugin.tsx
   - InputBar.tsx

5. Created front-end testing documentation to verify the changes.

These improvements make the codebase more maintainable, testable, and consistent by standardizing how state is accessed and how window events are handled throughout the application.
