A design in MaxsDesign format:

* Includes a breakdown of the required functionality such that the reading AI will be able to make the required changes
* Does not include any code as such
* lists, for each step of the design, the relevant files in MaxsFileList format 



MaxsFileList format:

Lists all files with full absolute paths, demarcated either side by backticks, thus:

```
`C:\Users\maxhe\source\repos\CloneTest\MaxsAiTool\AiStudio4\AiStudio4.Web\src\App.tsx`
`...`
```
